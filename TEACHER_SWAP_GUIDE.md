# Teacher Swap Request Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how teachers can request and manage timetable swaps in the system. Teachers can request to swap their timetable entries with other teachers, but all swaps require approval.

## How to Request a Swap

### Step 1: Access Your Timetable
1. Log in to your teacher account
2. Navigate to **"My Timetable"** (`/teacher/timetable`)
3. You'll see the complete weekly schedule with all teachers' classes
4. **Your entries will be draggable** (you can click and drag them)
5. **Other teachers' entries are visible but not draggable** (you can see them to choose swap targets)

### Step 2: Identify What You Want to Swap
- Look at your timetable entries (the colored blocks with your subjects)
- Find the entry you want to swap (your subject)
- Identify which other teacher's entry you want to swap with

### Step 3: Drag and Drop to Request
1. **Click and hold** on one of your timetable entries (your subjects only)
2. **Drag** it over another teacher's entry
3. **Drop** it on the target entry
4. The system will automatically create a swap request

### Step 4: Confirmation
- You'll see a success message: *"Swap Request Sent"*
- The other teacher will receive an email notification
- You'll also get a confirmation email

## Managing Your Swap Requests

### Accessing Swap Requests
1. Go to **"Manage Swap Requests"** (`/teacher/swaps`)
2. You'll see two tabs:
   - **Received Requests**: Requests from other teachers to swap with you
   - **Sent Requests**: Requests you've sent to other teachers

### Responding to Received Requests
1. In the **"Received Requests"** tab, find the pending request
2. Click **"Approve"** or **"Reject"** button
3. If approved, the swap happens immediately
4. Both teachers get email confirmations

### Managing Your Sent Requests
1. In the **"Sent Requests"** tab, view all your requests
2. You can cancel pending requests you've sent
3. Track the status of each request (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)

## Important Rules and Tips

### What You Can Do
✅ Request swaps for your own subjects only  
✅ Cancel pending requests you've sent  
✅ Approve or reject requests from other teachers  
✅ Track all your swap requests  
✅ Receive email notifications  

### What You Cannot Do
❌ Request swaps for other teachers' subjects  
❌ Force swaps without approval  
❌ Cancel requests that have been approved/rejected  
❌ Swap entries with different time durations  

### Best Practices
- **Provide a reason**: When possible, explain why you need the swap
- **Be respectful**: Don't send too many requests to the same teacher
- **Check your email**: You'll get notifications about request status
- **Plan ahead**: Request swaps well in advance when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"I can't see other teachers' entries"**
- Make sure you're on the teacher timetable page (`/teacher/timetable`)
- You should see all timetable entries, not just your own
- Contact admin if you only see your own entries

**"I can't drag an entry"**
- Make sure it's your own subject (you can only swap your own classes)
- Your entries will be draggable, other teachers' entries won't be
- Check that you're logged in as a teacher
- Try refreshing the page

**"The request failed"**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure both entries exist and are valid
- Contact admin if the issue persists

**"I don't see the other teacher's response"**
- Check your email (including spam folder)
- Go to the swap requests page to see the status
- The status will show as PENDING, APPROVED, or REJECTED

**"The swap didn't happen after approval"**
- Check if there are any conflicts (same teacher, same time slot)
- Contact admin if the issue persists

## Email Notifications

You'll receive emails for:
- **Swap request received**: When another teacher requests a swap with you
- **Swap request sent**: Confirmation when you send a request
- **Request approved**: When your request is approved
- **Request rejected**: When your request is rejected
- **Swap completed**: When a swap is successfully executed
